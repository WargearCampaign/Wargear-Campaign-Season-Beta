                     Instead of following the normal rules for Rapid Fire weapons, models in this unit shooting Rapid Fire bolt weapons make double the number of attacks if any of the following apply<br/>
                    <br/>
                    - The shooting model's target is within half the weapon's range<br/>
                    - The shooting model is Infantry (excluding Centurion models) and it's unit Remained Stationary in your previous Movement Phase. <br/>
                    - The shooting model is a Terminator or Biker<br/>
                    <br/>
                    For the purposes of this ability, a Rapid Fire bolt weapon is any bolt weapon (see page 195) with the Rapid Fire type.

                    - After both sides have finished deploying their armies, select one Battlefield Role. Until the end of the battle, each time a model with this tactical makes an attack against an enemy unit with that Battlefield Role, re-roll a wound roll of 1.

                     If every unit from your army has the ADEPTUS ASTARTES keyword (excluding AGENT OF THE IMPERIUM and ALIGNED units), this unit gains a bonus (see below) depending on which combat doctrine is active for your army, as follows:<br/>
                    <br/>
                    &#8226; During the first battle round, the Devastator Doctrine is active for your army.<br/>
                    &#8226; During the second battle round, the Tactical Doctrine is active for your army.<br/>
                    &#8226; At the start of the third battle round, select either the Tactical Doctrine or Assault Doctrine: until the end of that battle round, the doctrine you selected is active for your army.<br/>
                    &#8226; During the fourth and subsequent battle rounds, the Assault Doctrine is active for your army.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Unless specified otherwise, this bonus is not cumulative with any other rules that improve the Armour Penetration characteristic of a weapon (e.g. the Storm of Fire Warlord Trait).<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Devastator Doctrine<br/>
                    While this combat doctrine is active, improve the Armour Penetration characteristic of every Heavy and Grenade weapon that models in this unit are equipped with by 1.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Tactical Doctrine<br/>
                    While this combat doctrine is active, improve the Armour Penetration characteristics of every Rapid Fire and Assault weapon that models in this unit are equipped with by 1.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Assault Doctrine<br/>
                    While this combat doctrine is active, improve the Armour Penetration characteristic of every Pistol and Melee weapon that models in this unit are equipped with by 1.

                     If every unit from your army (excluding UNALIGNED units) has the DEATHWATCH keyword, then every unit that has the Combat Doctrines ability and is in a DEATHWATCH Detachment gains the Mission Tactics ability below:<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Do not use the rules in Codex: Space Marines to determine which combat doctrine is active for your army during each battle round. Instead, at the start of each battle round, select the Devastator Doctrine, Tactical Doctrine or Assault Doctrine. The combat doctrine you select is active for your army until the end of that battle round. Note, however, that when selecting a combat doctrine at the start of the battle round.<br/>
                    - You cannot select the Devastator Doctrine to be active for your army more than once during the battle.<br/>
                    - You cannot select the Tactical Doctrine to be active for your army more than twice during the battle.<br/>
                    - You cannot select the Assault Doctrine to be active for your army more than three times during the battle.

                    Each time an attack is made with a weapon firing this special-issue ammunition against a unit that does not have the VEHICLE or TITANIC keyword, add 1 to that attack&#8217;s wound roll.<br/>
